## Latest verified checkpoint — product motion and mobile gallery (2026-11-08)

- Latest verified `main` HEAD: `b429828f0ed8f967317934fffed32daffa7b6a5f`. Documentation-only checkpoint CI [42496528868](https://github.com/pooya-labs/pooya-labs-platform/actions/runs/42496528868) also passed on this exact HEAD: TypeScript, all three builds, 87/87 tests.
- Application motion and clean case-study hero commit: `714d4ea2ea017189886ddb4e0d2e386e19edcaf3`; browser QA harness update: `549c6a3c66eade850d175cddad3a7b7dea5466e8`.
- Eight case-study hero visuals are product-specific; the old generic orbit composition and static screenshot/monogram overlay were removed from the hero. Screenshots remain in the lower evidence gallery.
- The eight selected-project cards each have their own compact animated scene. Browser QA recorded running animations for all 8 cards at desktop and all 8 at mobile.
- Full-page mobile screenshot frames now allow native vertical touch scroll chaining. Chromium emulation passed on 16/16 localized project routes by verifying that the outer case-study page scroll position advances after the inner image reaches its lower edge.
- Repository CI [42496113019](https://github.com/pooya-labs/pooya-labs-platform/actions/runs/42496113019) passed TypeScript, all three build targets, and 87/87 contract tests.
- Browser QA [42496014812](https://github.com/pooya-labs/pooya-labs-platform/actions/runs/42496014812) passed 17/17 localized routes and 34/34 desktop/mobile viewport checks: zero failures, zero horizontal overflow, and zero confirmed axe violations. Thirty-six axe rule checks remain incomplete and need manual review.
- Private visual QA artifact: [13623776195](https://github.com/pooya-labs/pooya-labs-platform/actions/runs/42496014812). It includes desktop/mobile route captures and homepage project-grid captures at both viewport sizes.
- GitHub Pages [42496014762](https://github.com/pooya-labs/pooya-labs-platform/actions/runs/42496014762) passed build and deployment for the final application checkpoint. Public site: https://pooya-labs.github.io/pooya-labs-platform/.
- Physical Android confirmation is still pending. Desktop Chromium touch emulation is useful regression evidence but is not a substitute for checking an actual Android device/browser.
- No independent project repository was modified.

## Remaining Phase 7 / Phase 8 blockers

- Pooya must review the latest deployed portfolio on real desktop, mobile, and Android hardware, then approve the full visual redesign and project-card/case-study motion.
- Owner content approval remains open for biography/positioning, featured-project order, personal contribution statements, public project statuses, and contact details.
- Manual accessibility acceptance remains open: inspect the 36 incomplete axe checks and manually verify color contrast, focus visibility, keyboard-only operation, and screen-reader flow in both languages and themes.
- External LinkedIn/Facebook social-crawler rendering and cache-refresh validation for the 17 PNG social cards remains open.
- Phase 8 performance/security/privacy/recovery checks and deployment rollback rehearsal remain open.
- No V1 tag or production-readiness claim is authorized.
