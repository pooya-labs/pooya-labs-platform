# Next Task — Phase 7 pre-redesign readiness closeout

**Task ID:** P7-12  
**Checkpoint date:** 2026-11-08  
**Latest verified `main` docs checkpoint:** see [Project Status](STATUS.md) and [project-state.json](project-state.json)  
**Canonical repository:** `pooya-labs/pooya-labs-platform`

## Release order (owner-requested)

1. Finish Phase 7: all autonomous engineering, facts/source audit, accessibility, performance, security/privacy, SEO/social, deployment/recovery, and owner/device readiness preparation.
2. Phase 8 is penultimate: complete redesign of the entire public site, two owner feedback rounds, and explicit approval.
3. Phase 9 is the final implementation stage before publication: recheck and fully integrate all eight independent projects into the approved portfolio. Do not copy source code wholesale; retain repo boundaries unless a separate architecture decision is approved.
4. Phase 10: final V1 hardening and publication.

## Read-only source recheck — 2026-11-08

Latest read-only `main` heads inspected on 2026-11-08 19:30 UTC: AetherFlow `2ce6c7450186`, ORBIT `970d9723ee44`, Pooya.OS `f4b93d7f95a1`, NexusCanvas `9f2756b18466`, LuminaGlass `f8e6c958d33d`, AuraPulse `b4a83648025d`, GlobalCart `fed6f59f62c9`, and Salon Booking `ca745a46c863`. The full SHA/date inventory and inspected deltas are recorded in [PROJECT-CONTENT-AUDIT.md](PROJECT-CONTENT-AUDIT.md). Seven commits changed bilingual README ownership artwork only; GlobalCart added two storefront screenshots. These checks do not constitute final Phase 9 source/feature acceptance.

## Post-remediation verification checkpoint — 2026-11-08

- PR [#13](https://github.com/pooya-labs/pooya-labs-platform/pull/13) is merged. The hydration-safe case-study fix is on application commit [`045bc845`](https://github.com/pooya-labs/pooya-labs-platform/commit/045bc84526ef823a37599c6790d144d68465d35c); the current `main` also includes a later Persian README documentation commit.
- Repository CI [42513404028](https://github.com/pooya-labs/pooya-labs-platform/actions/runs/42513404028) passed dependency audit, lint/format, TypeScript, all three build targets, and repository contracts.
- Browser QA [42513404040](https://github.com/pooya-labs/pooya-labs-platform/actions/runs/42513404040) attempt 2 passed 18/18 routes and 36/36 viewports, zero failures, and zero confirmed axe violations. 36 incomplete gradient/pseudo-background contrast checks remain for manual review.
- Performance artifact [13630148273](https://github.com/pooya-labs/pooya-labs-platform/actions/runs/42513404040/artifacts/13630148273) reports 20 samples per host and p50/p75/maximum CLS **0.0000** on local build, GitHub Pages, and Cloudflare Pages. See [PERFORMANCE-BUDGET.md](PERFORMANCE-BUDGET.md).
- GitHub Pages deployment [42513404002](https://github.com/pooya-labs/pooya-labs-platform/actions/runs/42513404002) succeeded. Cloudflare production deployment [`592357af`](https://592357af.pooya-labs-platform.pages.dev/) succeeded through the authorized Pages API for the same application commit.
- Cloudflare's GitHub Actions automation still requires the private `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` secret. Apps Script publishing remains skipped until `CLASPRC_JSON`, `CLASP_JSON`, and `GAS_DEPLOYMENT_ID` are configured; do not represent the Apps Script Web App as updated by this checkpoint.

## Latest verified app/host checkpoint — centered monogram asset (2026-11-08)

- Application asset commit [`41ea1004`](https://github.com/pooya-labs/pooya-labs-platform/commit/41ea1004433196aa81e4e50b17a1620f110ecea8) adds the centered rounded black-tile Pooya Labs monogram asset. GitHub Pages build and deployment [42514976384](https://github.com/pooya-labs/pooya-labs-platform/actions/runs/42514976384) succeeded on that exact commit.
- Browser QA [42514976406](https://github.com/pooya-labs/pooya-labs-platform/actions/runs/42514976406) completed successfully: 18/18 routes, zero failures, zero confirmed Axe violations, and 36 incomplete color-contrast checks retained for human review. Artifact: [13631024148](https://github.com/pooya-labs/pooya-labs-platform/actions/runs/42514976406/artifacts/13631024148).
- The same run measured 20 cold-context samples per host. p75 CLS was 0.0000 on local build, GitHub Pages, and Cloudflare Pages. p75 LCP was 316 ms local, 400 ms GitHub Pages, and 400 ms Cloudflare Pages. Full navigation/resource figures are recorded in [PERFORMANCE-BUDGET.md](PERFORMANCE-BUDGET.md).
- Repository CI [42515288490](https://github.com/pooya-labs/pooya-labs-platform/actions/runs/42515288490) passed on current documentation head `a37de4cf`.
- Cloudflare production deployment [`107de2a2`](https://107de2a2.pooya-labs-platform.pages.dev/) (ID `107de2a2-d69c-4b9d-ae2c-38da68c7bad4`) was verified through the Cloudflare API on current `main` commit `a37de4cf21bc5e41f8fca9ea08ba6d6dfd350b67`; its queue, initialization, clone, build, and deploy stages all succeeded. This commit includes the `41ea1004` monogram-tile asset, so both public hosts now contain the current platform asset revision. The GitHub Actions Cloudflare publish workflow remains separately credential-gated by the private `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` secret; automatic push-triggered publishing is not yet proven.
- Apps Script workflow [42514976476](https://github.com/pooya-labs/pooya-labs-platform/actions/runs/42514976476) passed its configuration-check job but skipped the actual publish job because `CLASPRC_JSON`, `CLASP_JSON`, and `GAS_DEPLOYMENT_ID` are not configured. This does not block the static portfolio.


## Security automation checkpoint — 2026-11-08

- PR [#15](https://github.com/pooya-labs/pooya-labs-platform/pull/15) adds a dependency-free credential scanner for tracked UTF-8 files and both generated public bundles.
- Repository CI [42517885668](https://github.com/pooya-labs/pooya-labs-platform/actions/runs/42517885668) passed on PR head `e7b5d2e4a592700ea309ff55f4428947cd7e2816`: dependency audit **0 vulnerabilities**, three build targets successful, credential scan **no recognized matches**, contract tests **101/101**.
- The scan reports only path/line/rule, not secret values. It does not scan binary contents or Git history and is not exhaustive; these limitations are in [SECURITY-MODEL.md](SECURITY-MODEL.md).
- Continue the broader Phase 7 review: manual public/private asset boundary review, workflow/deployment permissions, link safety, human contrast/keyboard/screen-reader checks, social crawler validation, rollback rehearsal, and owner/device acceptance.


## Owner review packet prepared — 2026-11-08

- [`docs/OWNER-REVIEW-PACKET.md`](OWNER-REVIEW-PACKET.md) now consolidates the current bilingual homepage copy, project order, status and role wording, contact channels, media inventory, public disclosure boundaries, and the empty Novels decision.
- The packet is prepared but **not approved**. All eight project review states remain `needs-owner-review`; owner decisions on biography/copy, featured order, roles, statuses, public media, Salon Booking permission, and Novels content remain pending.
- PR [#16](https://github.com/pooya-labs/pooya-labs-platform/pull/16) includes the packet and a contract test that guards its coverage and non-approval language.


## Phase 7 work order

1. Complete repository-level quality, security, dependency, secret/asset boundary, and workflow review.
2. Measure baseline performance and define enforceable budgets; inspect the current browser QA artifacts and resolve reproducible defects.
3. Finish accessibility preparation, including a manual contrast matrix for gradient/pseudo backgrounds and keyboard/focus/screen-reader checks where accessible.
4. Configure the Cloudflare Actions secret privately for repeatable automatic publishing (the current manual Pages API production deployment is verified), decide whether Apps Script publishing is required and supply its three secrets if so, then rehearse rollback/recovery.
5. Verify current SEO/social preview behavior, project links and facts, and prepare the owner approval packet.
6. Collect the physical Android/device and owner/content acceptance inputs required to start Phase 8.

## Boundaries

- No V1 tag, no release claim, and no new design rebuild before the Phase 8 gate.
- No final project content/media import until Phase 9.
- Do not modify independent project repositories during this platform readiness pass unless a concrete blocker is explicitly approved as an upstream task.
- A missing owner approval, physical-device test, private credential, or third-party salon permission must remain an explicit blocker; do not mark it complete on the owner's behalf.
